When her biggest investor orders Josie to hire a consultant, the last person she expects to be working with is Will Grant ? the twin brother of Josie?s ex best friend.Sure, Will and Josie may have shared one mistake of a kiss during senior spring break nine years ago, but they?ve never been friends. She remembers him as moody; he always thought of her as shallow. Romance isn?t on the table for either of them until they blink, and realize there?s a reason they can?t stay away from each other.But there?s Will?s sister to consider ? whom Josie hasn?t spoken with since their falling out ? not to mention, Will and Josie live seventeen hundred miles apart. And it?s not like she has time for a boyfriend anyway </p>
